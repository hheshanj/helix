# Building a Modern Blog

This is the inaugural post on a blog built with **SvelteKit** and styled using a custom **Material Design 3** system on top of Tailwind CSS.

## Why SvelteKit?

SvelteKit is an exceptional framework for building fast, content-heavy websites:

- **Zero runtime overhead** — Svelte compiles your components to vanilla JS at build time
- **Static Site Generation** — with `adapter-static`, the entire site ships as pure HTML
- **File-based routing** — pages live where you'd expect them
- **Markdown support** — via `mdsvex`, writing content is as simple as creating a `.md` file

## Why Material Design 3?

Material You (M3) brings a refined design language with:

- **Tonal surfaces** — subtle elevation through color rather than heavy shadows
- **Dynamic palettes** — a cohesive color system built from a single seed color
- **High border radii** — everything feels soft and approachable

> The combination of SvelteKit's performance and M3's aesthetics creates something that's both fast and beautiful.

## What's Next?

I'll be writing about web development, design systems, and the tools I use daily. Stay tuned!
