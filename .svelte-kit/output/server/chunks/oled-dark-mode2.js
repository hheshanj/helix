Stay tuned!\r\n';

This means a true `#000000` background:\r\n\r\n- Uses zero power for those pixels\r\n- Creates infinite contrast ratios\r\n- Makes colors appear more vibrant\r\n\r\n## Designing with Tonal Surfaces\r\n\r\nMaterial Design 3 introduces the concept of **tonal containers** — instead of using drop shadows to show elevation, you use progressively lighter surface colors:\r\n\r\n- `surface` — `#000000` (OLED black)\r\n- `surface-container` — `#1c1b1f`\r\n- `surface-container-high` — `#252529`\r\n- `surface-container-highest` — `#302f33`\r\n\r\nThis creates a subtle sense of depth without relying on shadows that disappear on dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\n## Typography Matters\r\n\r\nUsing `Roboto Flex` with its variable font axes gives us fine-grained control over:\r\n\r\n- **Weight** — from 100 to 1000\r\n- **Width** — condensed to expanded\r\n- **Optical sizing** — automatic adjustments for readability at any scale\r\n\r\nThe result is typography that looks crisp on any screen density.\r\n';
